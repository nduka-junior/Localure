## Introduction

Localure is a revolutionary platform that bridges the gap between restaurants and diners. Our goal is to enhance the dining experience by providing a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore menus, view item details, and make informed choices.

## Features

### QR Code Scanning

Our QR code scanning feature enables users to access visual menus by simply scanning QR codes. This eliminates the need for physical menus and offers a contactless dining experience.

### Item Categorization

We've introduced a smart grouping system that categorizes food items into user-friendly lists. Users can conveniently explore categories such as 'Mocktails' or 'Varieties of Food' to find what they're looking for.

### Item Details

View detailed information about each food item, including its name, price, and images. This feature provides users with comprehensive information and tantalizing visuals to aid in their decision-making.

### Customization

Restaurant owners have the power to manage their menus in real-time. Easily add, edit, or remove food items, ensuring that customers always have access to the latest offerings.

### Search Functionality

Our platform allows users to search for restaurants and explore their menus. This expands dining options and encourages users to discover new places to enjoy a meal.

## Getting Started

### Signup

To start using Localure, users can sign up as either a 'Personal' or 'Business' account. This helps us tailor the experience to their needs.

### Onboarding

For restaurant owners, the onboarding process involves providing essential business details, including the name, location, and contact information. Additionally, owners can link their social media profiles for future updates.
